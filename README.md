Homework 1 as part of the data analytics module
This homework focuses on data understanding and preparation for a particular problem and dataset.
The data comes from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC: https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/). CDC is a USA health protection agency and is in charge of collecting data about the COVID-19 pandemic, and in particular, tracking cases, deaths, and trends of COVID-19 in the United States. CDC collects and makes public deidentified individual-case data on a daily basis, submitted using standardized case reporting forms. In this analysis, we focus on using the data collected by CDC to build a data analytics solution for death risk prediction. CDC collects demographic characteristics, exposure history, disease severity indicators and outcomes, clinical data, laboratory diagnostic test results, and comorbidities. It also includes information on whether the individual survived or not.

The dataset we work with is a sample of the public data released by CDC, where the outcome for the target feature death_yn is known (i.e., either 'yes' or 'no'):
